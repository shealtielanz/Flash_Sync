### FlashAbiImpl

The **FlashAbiImpl** is an essential interface that must be implemented by any contract intending to use flash loans. It ensures that the contract can correctly receive and manage the loan, as well as return the borrowed amount along with the fee. While additional logic can be added by the user, the core requirement is the implementation of the flash loan handling and repayment process.

### Key Features:
- **Mandatory for Flash Loan Users**: Any contract that wants to use flash loans must implement this ABI.
- **Customizable**: Users can include additional logic based on their needs, but core functionality must remain intact.
- **Funds Settlement**: It must forward the borrowed amount plus fees back to the *Flash Settler*, which ensures that the funds and fees are returned to the predicate for future use.

### Core Function: `useFlashLoan()`

The primary function required in the **FlashAbiImpl** is `useFlashLoan()`, which handles the logic for utilizing the borrowed funds and ensuring proper repayment.

#### Core Constraint:
- **Repayment Obligation**: The function must always ensure that the borrowed amount plus any associated fees are forwarded back to the *Flash Settler*.

### Workflow:
1. **Utilize the Loan**: The contract receives the borrowed funds and uses them according to the userâ€™s logic (e.g., arbitrage, refinancing).
2. **Repay Loan**: After the loan is used, the contract must forward the full borrowed amount, along with the fees, back to the *Flash Settler*.
3. **Flash Settler Handling**: The *Flash Settler* accounts for the fees and returns everything to the predicate, making the funds available for future loans.

By enforcing these constraints, the **FlashAbiImpl** guarantees that the flash loan is securely used and repaid within the same transaction.
