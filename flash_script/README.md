The **FlashLoan Script** is a simple yet essential component in the flash loan process. Its primary function is to facilitate the transfer of funds from the predicate to the *Flash Settler*, which then initiates the loan to the user. 

### Key Features:
- **Triggers Loan Disbursement**: The script sends the borrowed funds to the *Flash Settler*, which ensures proper handling of the loan.
- **Mandatory in Every Flash Loan**: Every flash loan must include the FlashLoan Script, as its bytecode hash is stored in the flash loan predicate and is checked during the TX. This serves as a validation step to ensure only approved transactions can interact with the predicate.

The inclusion of the FlashLoan Script guarantees that loans are executed securely and that all actions are traceable and governed by the smart contract's logic.
### Core Function: `main()`
The `main()` function in the **FlashLoan Script** is essential for processing flash loans. It accepts two inputs:
1. **Borrow Amount**: The amount the user wishes to borrow.
2. **Contract Identity**: The address of the contract that implements the *FlashAbi*, which is necessary for receiving and utilizing the flash loan.
### Function Overview:
- **Purpose**: To initiate the flash loan process by validating inputs and executing the loan transfer.
### Workflow:
1. **Execute Loan**:
   - If validations are successful, the function sends the borrowed amount to the specified contract via the *Flash Settler*.
By following this process, the `main()` function ensures that the flash loan is securely and correctly disbursed to the user.
