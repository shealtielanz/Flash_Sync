### FlashSettler: The FlashLoan Intermediary

The **FlashSettler** acts as an intermediary between the **FlashLoan Predicate** and the user of the flash loan, ensuring that all constraints and rules are adhered to throughout the transaction. Its role is critical in maintaining the integrity of the flash loan process, verifying that all steps are properly executed and ensuring the safe return of funds to the predicate.
### Key Features:
- **Intermediary Role**: Acts as the middle layer between the flash loan predicate and the user.
- **Enforces Constraints**: Ensures that all conditions, such as repayment and fee handling, are met before the transaction is finalized.
- **On-Chain Operation**: The FlashSettler operates directly on-chain and only interacts with the state during the transaction, maintaining the security of the loan disbursed.
### Core Function: `triggerFlashLoan()`
This function is the core of the **FlashSettler's** operation.
#### Workflow:
1. **Initiate Loan**: 
   - The FlashSettler automatically transfers the requested loan amount it got from the predicate to the user’s contract.
   
2. **Call User’s FlashLoan Logic**: 
   - Once the funds are transferred, the FlashSettler triggers the `use_FlashLoan()` function on the user's contract (which must implement *FlashAbi*), allowing the user to perform their intended operations (e.g., arbitrage, refinancing, etc.).

3. **Enforce Repayment**:
   - At the end of the transaction, the FlashSettler ensures that the user returns the borrowed amount plus the required fee back to the predicate.
### Summary:
- **Security**: The FlashSettler guarantees that the user repays the loan and fees within the same transaction.
- **Automation**: It automates the loan disbursement and repayment process, preventing unauthorized actions.
- **On-Chain Execution**: Since it only touches the state during the transaction, the FlashSettler ensures minimal risk and maximum security for flash loans.

In essence, the **FlashSettler** provides a reliable and secure mechanism for executing flash loans, acting as a safeguard that enforces the loan’s rules and ensuring the transaction is completed without loss of funds.
